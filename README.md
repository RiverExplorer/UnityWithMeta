Free and Open Source code for Unity and the Meta SDK

-- 
BumpBuildVersion is an independent little project that bumps the version field.
And on Android it increments the Buidle Version Code needed to push
to the Meta App store.

--
KeyStoreAsset is an independant little project that remembers the keystore name and password so you don't have to manually enter each time you start Unity.

There is a ReadMe.txt file in that directory that tells you how to use it.
